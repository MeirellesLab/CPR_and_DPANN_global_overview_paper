#' @title Install and load libraries
#' @description This function verifies the installed libs them installs
#' the absent ones, load them and warns you if the installed version is
#' different from the specified.
#' @param libs is a named chr of libraries to install and load. The names
#' are the library names and the values are the ideal version.
#' @param loc is the location where the libraries will be installed.
#' set to NULL to install in the default R library directory.
#' @warning The function DOESN'T install the libraries in the specified version
#' it only verifies if the installed version is the same as the specified and
#' warns you.
